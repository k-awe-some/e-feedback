# eFeedback

Credit-based email service that lets businesses collect feedbacks from customers faster than ever!

## Description

Targeted at start-ups, eFeedback is a campaign management platform that allows its users (from this point referred to as **users**) to create surveys and email them to their selected customers (from this point referred to as **end users**). The end users on receiving the surveys will also be provided with different options (usually two) to respond (by clicking the corresponding links) as per survey. The (eFeedback) users will then be informed of the responses' stats thus making meaningful business adjustments.
